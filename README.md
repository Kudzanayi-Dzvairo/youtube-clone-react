## Reflection

This project was built using React and the goal was to practice state management using Hooks.

Info was pulled from the youtube API and I started using the `create-react-app` boilerplate.

This was an enjoyable challenge. While the concept of hooks is rather simple I did struggle with grasping how to build custom hooks but I managed to implement one one in this project to make API calls.

Project was built with React and styled with Material UI
